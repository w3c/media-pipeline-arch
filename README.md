# Media pipeline architecture

This repository contains architectural considerations for the evolution of the
media pipeline on the web.

The goal of the repository is to discuss architectural issues that cross
multiple working group boundaries, e.g. through code samples, and identify
gaps in technologies developed by these working groups and opportunities for
further alignment.

This is started as a joint effort between the
[Media Working Group](https://www.w3.org/media-wg/) and the
[WebRTC Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webrtc), following
[discussions during TPAC 2022](https://www.w3.org/2022/09/15-mediawg-minutes.html).
